You can use the editor on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Modify _config.yml to change the left sidebar content, including mug shot and personal name.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
